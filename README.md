# Dr.-Semmelweis-and-the-discovery-of-handwashing
Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was a Hungarian physician born in 1818 and active at the Vienna General Hospital. If Dr. Semmelweis looks troubled it's probably because he's thinking about &lt;em>childbed fever&lt;/em>: A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth. He is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it. He is thinking about it because he knows the cause of childbed fever: It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and &lt;em>wash their hands&lt;/em>!&lt;/p> &lt;p>In this notebook, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of &lt;em>handwashing&lt;/em>. Let's start by looking at the data that made Semmelweis realize that something was wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital.
